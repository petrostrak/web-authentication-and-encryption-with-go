Authorization Request
To request authorization, the client (website) must redirect the user-agent (browser) 
to make a secure HTTP call to https://www.amazon.com/ap/oa with the following parameters. 
If you are using the Authorization header to request access tokens, note that it should 
be a base-64 encoding of client_id:client:secret.

Access Token Request
After the client (website) receives an Authorization Response with a valid authorization code, 
it can use that code to obtain an access token. With an access token, the client can read a 
customer profile. To request an access token, the client makes a secure HTTP POST to 
https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token
